Designed and developed Machine Learning Classification and Segmentation (U-net) models for detecting and predicting disease severity in Covid-19 patients using pre-trained architecture such as InceptionV3 and Res-Net.

Calculated the percentage of disease spread in the lungs, and compared the performance and accuracy of the InceptionV3 and Res-net architectures.

On CT-Lungs images trained using various Hyperparameters, model accuracy ranged from 88 to 95%.
