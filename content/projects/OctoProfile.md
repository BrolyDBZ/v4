Implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a master process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers.Build something similar to the paper [MapReduce paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf).
