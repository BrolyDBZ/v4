Designed and developed Machine Learning Classification and Segmentation (U-net) models for detecting and predicting disease severity in Covid-19 patients using pre-trained architecture such as InceptionV3 and Res-Net.

Compared the performance and accuracy of the different architectures. The model's accuracy ranged from 88 to 95% On CT-Lungs images trained using various hyperparameters.
